                This is an interactive simulation examines the impacts of Seasonal Affective Disorder (SAD). It simulates how the changes in seasons impact moods. Participants can interact with several elements, such as sunlight, serotonin, and melatonin levels, to see how this affect mood. When the light intensity is changed, the system records the changes in mood through the expressions and movements of a robot character. This way, it is possible to understand visually how different conditions impact emotional states.

                The project also demonstrates various therapeutic interventions, such as Light Therapy, Exercise, and Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT), so that users can activate these strategies and see how they affect mood and serotonin levels. This simulation provides a hands-on understanding of SAD, demonstrating how seasonal changes and certain treatments impact mental health, thus creating awareness of this condition and its management.
