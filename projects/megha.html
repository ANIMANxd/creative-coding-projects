                This p5.js simulation visualizes the circulatory system by illustrating the flow of oxygenated and de oxygenated blood within the body. The heart is represented by a pulsating red shape, expanding and contracting to mimic the beating of the heart. The blue blood represents oxygenated blood and starts from the left side of the canvas, moving towards the center of the heart. Once it reaches the heart, it resets and starts again. The red blood represents de oxygenated blood, which flows from the heart and moves towards the right side of the canvas, symbolizing its journey to the body tissues.

                    The heart's size fluctuates based on the heart rate, which can be adjusted using a slider, and the blood flow speed is also adjustable with a separate slider. The blood drops are drawn as larger circles for better visibility. This interactive simulation helps users understand the circulatory system by allowing real-time adjustments to heart rate and blood flow.
