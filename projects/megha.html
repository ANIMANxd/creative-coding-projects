                The circulatory system is responsible for transporting blood, nutrients, gases (like oxygen), and waste products throughout the body. It consists of the heart, blood vessels, and blood. The heart pumps blood through the pulmonary circuit (to the lungs) and the systemic circuit (to the body). Blood vessels include arteries (which carry oxygen-rich blood), veins (which return deoxygenated blood), and capillaries (where gas and nutrient exchange occurs).

                In p5.js, I have simulated the circulatory system using visualizations. For example, the ellipse() function can represent the heart or blood cells, blue circles indicating oxygenated blood and red circles indicating de oxygenated blood. By using frameRate(), I have  animated the pumping action of the heart, making the blood flow rhythmically. Interactive elements like mousePressed() can change blood flow or oxygen levels in the system, engaging users with the learning process through coding and visual art.
