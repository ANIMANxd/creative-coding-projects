                View the effects of varying rainfall levels on water-sensitive crops, focusing on loamy soil conditions. Using an interactivevisualisationn, users can explore how low, moderate, and high rainfall impacts soil erosion and crop health for maize, rice, and tomatoes. 
            <br>
            <p>
                The simulation highlights the dynamics of loamy soil, known for its balanced drainage and fertility, under different rainfall scenarios. For instance, tomatoes are susceptible to rotting under excessive rain, maize experiences stunted growth during droughts or high stress under heavy rain. At the same time,e rice thrives in wet conditions but may struggle when water levels become excessive.

                By observing rainfall-induced changes like erosion and crop stress in real time, users can better understand the delicate balance required for cultivating water-sensitive crops. This tool is a learning platform for farmers, students, and researchers, helping them assess and manage agricultural challenges in varying climatic conditions.
