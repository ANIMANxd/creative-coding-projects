                This project simulates the effects of varying rainfall levels on water-sensitive crops, focusing on loamy soil conditions. Using an interactive visualization, users can explore how low, moderate, and high rainfall impacts soil erosion and crop health for maize, rice, and tomatoes. 

                The simulation highlights the dynamics of loamy soil, known for its balanced drainage and fertility, under different rainfall scenarios. For instance, tomatoes are susceptible to rotting under excessive rain, maize experiences stunted growth during droughts or high stress under heavy rain, while rice thrives in wet conditions but may struggle when water levels become excessive. 
                
                By observing rainfall-induced changes like erosion and crop stress in real-time, users can better understand the delicate balance required for cultivating water-sensitive crops. This tool serves as a learning platform for farmers, students, and researchers, helping them assess and manage agricultural challenges in varying climatic conditions.
