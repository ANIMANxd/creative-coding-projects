                The influence of social media on the mood of an individual using p5.js. It creates a visual environment where users can interact with various elements like social media icons, influencers, and notifications. The user's mood is represented by a bar at the bottom of the screen, with its color and length changing based on the mood value (ranging from 0 to 100).

                There are two types of influencers: negative and positive. Negative influencers decrease the mood, while positive ones increase it. Social media icons and connections between them move randomly, representing the dynamic nature of social interactions. Notifications, which can be positive, neutral, or negative, also affect the mood.
                
                The mood is visually represented by fluctuating emotional clouds, where clicking on different areas of the canvas can either improve or worsen the mood. Overall, the code explores the impact of social media and interactions on mental health, offering an interactive and visual representation of these influences.        <br><br>
