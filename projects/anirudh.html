                How do ant colonies efficiently locate and gather food through pheromone-based communication? The simulation illustrates the phenomenon of stigmergy, where ants indirectly coordinate their foraging behaviour through environmental modifications.
                When ants discover food sources, they deposit chemical pheromone trails during their return journey to the colony. These trails serve as a communication mechanism, attracting other ants and creating a positive feedback loop. The strength of these pheromone trails gradually evaporates over time, mimicking real-world behaviour where less efficient paths naturally fade away.

                The simulation features adjustable parameters, including ant population size, pheromone strength, and evaporation rates. You can interact with the environment by placing food sources and obstacles, allowing observation of how the colony adapts its foraging strategies. The visualisation displays both the ants' movement patterns and the intensity of pheromone trails, demonstrating how individual ant behaviours emerge into complex collective intelligence.

            <p>This project demonstrates fundamental concepts in swarm intelligence, showcasing how simple rules followed by individual ants can lead to sophisticated collective problem-solving behaviour.
