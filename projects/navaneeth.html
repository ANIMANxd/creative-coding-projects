                This code simulates the behaviour of bees interacting with flowers in different environments and seasons using the p5.js library. It initializes arrays for bees and flowers, each with properties like nectar and energy. The program allows users to adjust the temperature with a slider, select the season, and choose the habitat type (Urban, Rural, or Forest). The bees, represented by yellow circles, seek out blooming flowers to collect nectar, which can be used for pollination, increasing pollination success. The flowers bloom and produce nectar, but the bees' activity depends on the current weather conditions and season.

                <p>
                    For example, in Winter or Rainy seasons, or when the temperature is too high or low, the bees become inactive, indicated by a red message. The simulation also draws the environment, with blooming flowers, seasonal rain, and different habitats represented visually. Stats like pollination success and temperature are displayed on the screen.
