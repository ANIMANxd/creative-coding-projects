                An interactive visualization tool designed to demonstrate the interplay between network infrastructure and environmental conditions. Tt provides a dynamic representation of data packet transmission across various network nodes, including homes, Internet Service Providers, cell towers, data centers, and satellites.

            <p>
                The simulator incorporates a sophisticated environmental system featuring day/night cycles, weather patterns, and realistic landscape elements. Users can adjust environmental parameters using intuitive sliders, allowing control over the time of day (0â€“100) and weather conditions (ranging from clear to stormy). The visualization dynamically responds to these inputs, showcasing moving clouds, rain effects, and context-aware network alerts during severe weather. 
            </p><br>
            <p>
                Key features include real-time packet transmission visualization, weather-dependent network performance, interactive environmental controls, detailed infrastructure visualization, intelligent traffic routing simulation, and dynamic landscape elements like trees and roads. By automatically adjusting network performance based on weather severity, the NetScape Simulator offers a realistic and engaging demonstration of how environmental factors influence network connectivity.
