                This is an interactive network visualization project created using p5.js that simulates data packet transmission across a small-scale network infrastructure. The simulation includes homes, a data center, cell towers, and an ISP, all connected through various network paths. What makes this visualization unique is its integration of environmental elements that affect network performance.

                The project features a dynamic day/night cycle and weather system that impacts network operations. Users can control these conditions through sliders: one for transitioning between day and night (affecting the sky color and celestial bodies), and another for weather conditions ranging from clear to stormy. During severe weather (>70 on the scale), the simulation automatically stops and displays a network alert warning.
                
                The visualization includes aesthetic elements like animated clouds, rain effects, and decorative trees along a road. Data packets are represented as moving dots that travel between network nodes, and users can start or stop the simulation using control buttons. The entire scene is rendered on a 500x350 pixel canvas, creating a comprehensive view of a local network ecosystem.
