                This project demonstrates the epidemiological process by which an infection spreads among the given population. Agents are defined to mimic the way people move about within a restricted area and can be shifted between four states: "susceptible," "infected," "quarantined," and "vaccinated." The game starts with some small number of people, and other people can be added to the game.
                <br>
            <p>
                Infection spreading: Susceptible agents are liable to get infected by some infected agents that exist beside them.
Quarantine: The infected people are taken to a separate place after some time
Vaccination: After some time, the person is vaccinated so that he/she will not be infected again
Movement: People are allowed to move anywhere in the area but boundaries are created so that people do not leave the simulation area

            </p><br>
            <p>
                The simulation delivers real-time images that comprise of: Color-coded people indicating their health status and special areas for quarantine and vaccination. The updates with regards to the count of infected, under quarantine, and the people vaccinated. This project brings into idea the impact activities on public health like quarantine and vaccination produce on the infectious disease transmission.
