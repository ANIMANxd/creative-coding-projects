                This project creates a 3D interactive simulation of a black hole using p5.js. 
                Users can adjust the black holeâ€™s mass, spin, and charge with sliders to see how these changes affect its gravity, accretion disk, and nearby objects. The simulation includes stars, planets that orbit the black hole, and a rotating accretion disk. As planets get closer to the black hole, they are pulled in faster and stretched out, showing the spaghettification effect. The event horizon is marked clearly, and the size of the accretion disk changes with the black hole's mass. Educational cards provide information on key black hole phenomena like Hawking radiation. This project aims to visually demonstrate the complex behavior of black holes in a simple and engaging way.        <br><br>
