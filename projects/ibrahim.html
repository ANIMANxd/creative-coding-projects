                This project showcases an interactive audio visualizer that dynamically responds to live audio input, providing an immersive and engaging viewing experience. Using the p5.js library, the visualizer processes real-time sound data from the user's microphone and translates it into stunning visual effects. The display features a grid of 3D shapes, such as boxes, spheres, and cones, which change in size and position based on the audio frequenciesâ€”bass, mid, and treble. As the sound spectrum fluctuates, the shapes pulse and rotate in sync with the beats, creating a vibrant and reactive environment. The visualizer also incorporates dynamic lighting effects that adjust based on the audio, adding depth and dimension to the scene. Users can interact with the system through UI buttons to modify settings, change the shape type, adjust rotation speed, toggle lighting, and even select different colors for the visual elements. This project combines art and technology to create a truly interactive audio-visual experience.
