                Explore forest fire using a grid-based model. Every cell in the grid is a patch of forest with varying densities of vegetation. The fire spreads dynamically based on wind direction and vegetation density, providing an interactive and visually engaging experience.

                <p>
                    The grid starts with random densities of vegetation, represented as shades of green; darker shades represent denser vegetation. Users can click on any cell to initiate a fire, represented by an orange-red colour. Fire spreads to neighbouring cells based on two factors: the wind direction (which can be changed by using arrow keys or specific hotkeys) and the density of vegetation, which influences the probability of spread. Burned cells turn grey to indicate that they will not catch fire again.

                    The wind direction is represented on the drawing canvas by an arrow and expressed in text. The simulation demonstrates natural phenomena, such as fire spreading, wind influence, and environmental conditions, which present an educational yet interactive way of learning about ecological modelling.
