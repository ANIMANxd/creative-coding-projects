                This program simulates the interaction between Earth's magnetic field, solar wind particles, and the resulting auroras in an animated visualization. The Earth is represented as a blue circle at the center of the canvas, surrounded by magnetic field lines. These field lines are dynamic and curve around the Earth, making real magnetic field patterns.

                Solar wind particles are created when the user clicks the mouse, emitting particles that move towards the Earth. As these particles interact with the magnetic field, they may generate auroras near the poles, represented as colorful, glowing ovals that fade over time. The simulation captures the dynamic nature of solar wind and aurora formation, blending interactivity with educational value.
                
                Field lines and particle behavior are calculated using trigonometric functions and vector mathematics, offering a visually engaging experience. This project is ideal for demonstrating the relationship between space weather phenomena and Earth's magnetic field in a creative and interactive way.            </p>
