                "Eco-Budget" is an engaging game that highlights the environmental impact of consumerism by making players aware of the hidden costs of everyday decisions. Players navigate scenarios like shopping or upgrading their homes, balancing a budget of money and eco-points. Each choice reveals detailed ecological consequences, such as carbon footprint, water usage, and waste generation.

                With levels ranging from individual purchases to corporate decision-making, the game challenges players to make sustainable choices while managing trade-offs. Features like environmental impact trackers, dynamic feedback, and detailed reports educate players on the unseen effects of their consumption habits.
                
                Ideal for students, families, businesses, and policymakers, "Eco-Budget" fosters eco-consciousness through gamification, encouraging behavior change and sustainable decision-making. By simulating real-world consequences, it empowers players to reflect on consumerism's role in environmental degradation and explore practical ways to minimize their footprint.
