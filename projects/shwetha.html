                Eco-Budget is an engaging game that highlights the environmental impact of consumerism by making players aware of the hidden costs of everyday decisions. Players navigate scenarios like packing their bags for school, and balancing budget eco-points. Each choice reveals detailed ecological consequences, such as carbon footprint, water usage, and waste generation.
                the game challenges players to make sustainable choices while managing.

                Ideal for students "Eco-Budget" fosters eco-consciousness through gamification, encouraging behavior change and sustainable decision-making. By simulating real-world consequences, it empowers players to reflect on consumerism's role in environmental degradation and explore practical ways to minimise their footprint.
